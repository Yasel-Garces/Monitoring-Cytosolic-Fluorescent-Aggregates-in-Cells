# Statistical Analysis and Visualization
This directory contains the R scripts used for the statistical analysis and data visualization. We only have two files in this directory:
1. **Analysis and Plot.R**: R codes for data manipulation, data wrangling, hypothesis tests, and data visualization.
2. **Functions.R**: It includes some utilities functions used in "Analysis and Plot.R".
