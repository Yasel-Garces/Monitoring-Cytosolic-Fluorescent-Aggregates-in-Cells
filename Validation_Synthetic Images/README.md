# Segmentation Algorithm Validation
The algorithm validation was performed using synthetic "ground truth" images, generated taking into account diffraction, white noise, dark-current noise and signal amplification [[Sinko et al., 2014](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-22-16-18940), [Garc√©s et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36505)].
